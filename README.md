## Winning Space Race with Data Science

## IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

Problem Statement:
SpaceX is successful because their rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Spaces X’s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets. There are three stages of a rocket launch. The payload is enclosed in the fairings. Stage two, or the second stage, helps bring the payload to orbit, but most of the work is done by the first stage. This stage does most of the work and is much larger than the second stage. This stage is quite large and expensive. Unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 can recover the first stage. Sometimes the first stage does not land. Sometimes it will crash. Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stage due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit, and customer.

In this project, you will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company - Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I did this by gathering information about SpaceX and creating dashboards for the team. I also determined if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I trained a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

Objective:
The objective is very clear. I have to evaluate the viability of the new company Space Y to compete with Space X.
